Dataset is from Kaggle, scraped together by Jean-Nicholas Hould. [Kaggle link to data](https://www.kaggle.com/nickhould/craft-cans)
[Jean-Nicholas' website on scraping the data](http://www.jeannicholashould.com/python-web-scraping-tutorial-for-craft-beers.html)

Additionally, I will aggregate beer ratings and user reviews from ratebeer.com using their [API access](https://www.ratebeer.com/api-documentation.asp)
