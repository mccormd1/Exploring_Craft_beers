## Data Overview
Here you introduce the data sources, the intent of the EDA, etc. The data source is https://www.kaggle.com/nickhould/craft-cans/data. data is in two tables, beers and breweries that contains information about different craft beers and craft breweries, respectively.


# Load Data

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, load_data }
#library(tidyverse)
#edadata<-read.csv("datasource.csv")
```

# Data Cleaning
Here you explore data structure and clean data if necessary. Note data formats, types and meaning

```{r data_cleaning}
#summary(edadata)
```

# Visualizations

## Univariate Analysis

```{r univariate_plot}
#ggplot(data=edadata,x=variable1)+
#  geom_bar()
```

Communicate what is important about this visualization after EVERY plot. Iterate.

### Univariate Summary
#### What is the structure of your dataset?

#### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?

#### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

#### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?

#### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?


## Bivariate Analysis

Start with a ggpairs, as it plots all the bivariates at once.
```{r  ggpairs_analysis}
# library(GGally)
# library(scales)
# library(memisc)
# 
# ggpairs(edadata)
```


```{r bivariate_plot}
# ggplot(data=edadata,x=variable1,y=variable2)+
#   geom_point()
# 
# with(edadata,cor.test())
```
re-plot interesting pairs with better scaling etc. Explore correlations as well.

### Bivariate Summary
#### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?

#### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?

#### What was the strongest relationship you found?


## Multivariate Analysis

```{r corr_test}
# ggplot(data=edadata,x=variable1,y=variable2,color=variable3)+
#   geom_point()
```

use color, size, etc to explore more complex interactions. look for color banding, transformations towards linearity, and other things to inform building a simple model.



## Modeling Data
optional part, use a model to try to fit data.

```{r "Modeling with ordinal regression"}
# 
# m1 <- polr(quality ~ variable1, data = edadata, Hess=TRUE)
# m2 <- update(m1, ~ . + variable2)
# m3 <- update(m2, ~ . + variable3)
# 
# mtable(m1, m2, m3)

```

### Multivariate Summary
#### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of looking at your feature(s) of interest?

#### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?

#### OPTIONAL: Did you create any models with your dataset? Discuss the strengths and limitations of your model.

# Final Plots


```{r final_plot1}
# copied from above
```
Highlight the most impactful and interesting plots from above, giving a standalone discription of the plot and what it shows.

# Grand Summary and Reflection

Reflect on data quality - the difficulties and deficits of the data - and potential options to expand data collection to remedy deficits.

Reflect on data structure that appeals to common beliefs about the data, structure that challenges preconceived notions, and most importantly any surprising and un-thought-of structure that stands out.

Note on next steps (collect more data, further exploration, machine learning)
